Description
-------------

This program contains two parts:

(1) Create a two dimensional matrix with m rows and n columns (m and n are defined at the beginning). Randomly generate "1"s (with probability p) and "0"s (with probability 1-p) and fill them into the matrix (p is also defined before). Then print the matrix.

(2) Traverse around the matrix. If there is a "1" in any cell of a row (or a column), then set all cells in the entire rows (or columns) to "1". Finally print the modified matrix.


Installation
------------

To install, simply run

    gcc A1A.c -std=c99 -o A1A


Execution
-----------

Run it using

    ./A1A
